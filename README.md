## Tell us what your idea is. 
Over the globe, over one in 160 children is an autistic child. Every autistic child needs lots of love and care, and with that, they need patience in learning. Autistic children are slow in learning compared to healthy children, and itâ€™s difficult for them to express in words what they are feeling. So, my idea is to implement an application that makes it easier for the autistic child to express his thoughts and to understand what people are trying to tell him. This application will have an area where children will have different emojis and pictures to express and numbers, music, actions, starter phrases, and all to help improve their learning process easier and comfortable. This application will make sure that the problem, like listening at a loud volume or problem in seeing the image, will be taken care of and will work with those instructions as per filled by the user. Machine learning will help by upgrading every level as the kid gets comfortable with learning and in resolving the problems the kid has like making images easier invisibility for the child. Machine learning will help in knowing the words that the child speaks in mic. By using machine learning, the above-defined problems will be solved. With this idea, the autistic children who are facing issues in their daily life will be resolved.

## Tell us how you plan on bringing it to life. 

- Where the project is currently: Currently, I have only been able to create welcome and picture screens using Android Navigation Components. I have also been able to create implicit intents that will enable the user to either take a photo with an existing camera application or upload a photo from the gallery.
- List of Ways Google Can help: 
    - Mentorship: A mentor that keeps us accountable and encourages us to keep going when things are not going when things get tough will be greatly appreciated. Having a mentor will help us and push us to keep going will really go a long way.
- Timeline for our Project:
    - December 2019: Designing UI/UX of the Application and Research about the model using in Machine Learning.
    - January 2019: Taking Help from Mentors at Google about the integration of Machine Learning Model and Android Application.
    - February -March 31st, 2019: Development of the Application and complete integration of the TensorFlow Model converted into TensorFlow Lite.
    - April 1st, 2019 - April 15th, 2019: Testing of the Application is going to complete, and the bug issues will be fixed. We would have completed the project, Given hope to blind people, and made me and my team, Google, Local Google Communities, and our assigned mentor proud.
    - April 16th, 2019: Submission of the Application and making the presentation of the Application.
